% QTILE Tile space of time, frequency, and Q for discrete Q transform analysis
%
% QTILE covers the specified range of time, frequency, and Q with the minimum
% number of measurement tiles such that the fractional energy loss encountered
% by an arbitrary minimum uncertainty signal never exceeds the requested maximum
% mismatch.  QTILE is typically called once for a particular set of search
% parameters.  The resulting tiling structure is then used in subsequent calls
% to QTRANSFORM on different data segments.
%

%  maximumMismatch    fractional loss in squared signal energy due to mismatch
%  highPassCutoff     cutoff frequency for high pass filter
%  lowPassCutoff      cutoff frequency for low pass filter
%  whiteningDuration  duration of whitening filter
%  transientFactor    ratio of transient duration to whitening filter duration
%
%  tiling             output discrete Q transform tiling structure
%
% To define the targeted signal space, QTILE takes as arguments the duration,
% frequency band, and Q range of the search.  The desired duration should be
% specified as a single scalar number, while the desired frequency range and Q
% range should both be two component vectors that specify the minimum and
% maximum frequency and Q for the analysis.
%
% This signal space cannot be specified arbitrarily.  In order to avoid
% frequency domain aliasing, QTILE enforces a minimum permissible Q of sqrt(11)
% and a maximum permissible analysis frequency that depends on Q.  In order to
% ensure a sufficient number of statistically independent tiles in each
% frequency row, QTILE also enforces a minimum permissible analysis frequency
% that depends on Q.  For convenience, the maximum permissible frequency range
% may be obtained for each Q plane by specifying a frequency range of [].
% Alternatively, the minimum permissible frequency may be obtained by specifying
% a lower limit of 0 Hz and the maximum permissible frequency by specifiying an
% upper limit of Inf Hz.
%
% QTILE also reports recommended filter parameters for data conditioning that
% include cutoff frequencies for high pass and low pass filters and whitening
% filter duration.  It also reports a recommended duration to ignore at both
% beginning and end of the transform due to filter transients.  This transient
% duration is simply the product of the whitening filter duration and a user
% specified factor.  If no transient factor is specified, a default value of
% four is used.  The user may also override the suggested data conditioning
% filter parameters by providing alternative parameters as arguments to QTILE.
