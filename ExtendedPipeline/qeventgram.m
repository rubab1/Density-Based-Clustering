% QEVENTGRAM Display statistically significant time-frequency events
%
% QEVENTGRAM Displays filled boxes corresponding to the time-frequency boundary
% of statistically significant events.  QEVENTGRAM takes as input a cell array
% of event matrices, one per channel. A separate figure is produced for each
% channel.  The resulting spectrograms are logarithmic in frequency and linear
% in time, with the tile color denoting normalized energy.

%     referenceTime           reference time of plot
%     timeRange               vector range of relative times to plot
%     frequencyRange          vector range of frequencies to plot
%     durationInflation       multiplicative factor for tile durations
%     bandwidthInflation      multiplicative factor for tile bandwidths
%     normalizedEnergyRange   vector range of normalized energies for colormap
%     channelNames            cell array of channel names
%
%     handles                 vector of axis handles for each eventgram
%
% QEVENTGRAM expects a cell array of Q transform event structures with one cell
% per channel.  The event structures contain the following fields, which
% describe the properties of statistically significant tiles.
%
%   time                 center time of tile [gps seconds]
%   frequency            center frequency of tile [Hz]
%   q                    quality factor of tile []
%   normalizedEnergy     normalized energy of tile []
%   signalAmplitude      signal amplitude of tile [Hz^-1/2]
%   phase                phase of tile [radians]
%
% The user can focus on a subset of the times and frequencies available in the
% original transform data by specifying a desired time and frequency range.
% Ranges should be specified as a two component vector, consisting of the
% minimum and maximum value.  By default, the full time and frequency range
% specified in the tiling is displayed.  The default values can be obtained for
% any argument by passing the empty matrix [].
%
% To determine the range of times to plot, QEVENTGRAM also requires a reference
% time in addition to the specified time range.  This reference time should be
% specified as an absolute quantity, while the range of times to plot should be
% specified relative to the requested reference time.  The specified reference
% time is used as the time origin in the resulting eventgrams and is also
% reported in the title of each plot.  A reference time of zero is assumed by
% default.
%
% If only one channel is requested, its eventgram is plotted in the current
% figure window.  If more than one eventgram is requested, they are plotted in
% separate figure windows starting with figure 1.
%
% The optional durationInflation and bandwidthInflation arguments are
% multiplicative scale factors that are applied to the duration and bandwidth of
% displayed events.  If not specified, these parameters both default to unity
% such that the resulting events have unity time-frequency area.
%
% The optional normalizedEnergyRange argument specifies the range of values to
% encode using the colormap.  By default, the lower bound is zero and the upper
% bound is autoscaled to the maximum normalized energy encountered in the
% specified range of time and frequency.
%
% The optional cell array of channel names are used to label the resulting
% figures.
%
% QEVENTGRAM returns a vector of axis handles to the eventgram produced for each
% channel.
